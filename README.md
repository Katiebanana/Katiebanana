### Hi there 👋

- 📊 I'm a data analyst, marketer, writer, and amateur painter!
- 👩‍💻 I have a background in both Data Science and PR. I love to use the intersection of the two disciplines to distill business insights through data and communicate across teams
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning Algorithms, Linear Algebra, Statistical Models and how to use them to solve business problems
- 📫 Reach me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/katiechak/ or email: chakw2020@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have travelled through 20+ countries and 50+ cities. Ask me about the best places I've been to!
